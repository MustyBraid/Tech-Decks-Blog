Hello! This is a project by Casey Chartier, or Mustybraid if you prefer. My Github is located at https://github.com/MustyBraid and I can be reached by email at chartiercasey@gmail.com.

This project uses a session manager and a sequelize database to handle user account registration and store blog posts. There's a good chunk of front end work that needs to be done, but that's not my favorite thing to do so it's fine!

This was a great project for me because it required me to go back and dig into how Handlebars ACTUALLY works. I was carried a little bit by my teammates during the Handlebars project, so it was nice to finally work on it. Session handling is another really important thing to learn, and thankfully it seems really easy!

A link to me giving a walkthrough of this project is currently hosted at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mtm4ybbmQKKM2lABEhiUSWg15Xgi8kUB/view
