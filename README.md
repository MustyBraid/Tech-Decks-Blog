Hello! This is a project by Casey Chartier, or Mustybraid if you prefer. My Github is located at https://github.com/MustyBraid and I can be reached by email at chartiercasey@gmail.com.

This project uses the inquirer package to take user input, and sequelize, express, and axios to manipulate several databases with that input. Currently only Employees and roles have a database, but only a few short changes would be needed to get the Departments database online.

I made this with Sequelize to sidestep some basic sql work, as the next two homework assignments I've been working on both also use sequelize and I didn't want to have to switch stacks too much while catching up. Axios is very straightforward and after writing two projects that heavily used express.router architecture I feel quite comfortable with that package, it's really neat.

A link to me giving a walkthrough of this early version of the project is currently hosted at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DbAgFvqxKWY4WPZIY65y7lk2m4Vz8_OI/view
